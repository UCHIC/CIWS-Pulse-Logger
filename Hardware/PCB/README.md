## Parts List
CSV of components available in [Hardware/PCB/Full_Res_Board/Full_Res_Board.csv](https://github.com/UCHIC/CIWS-Pulse-Logger/blob/main/Hardware/PCB/Full_Res_Board/Full_Res_Board.csv).

## Instructions
For convenience several common fabrication files have been generated and can be found in [Hardware/PCB/KiCad/FabFiles](https://github.com/UCHIC/CIWS-Pulse-Logger/tree/main/Hardware/PCB/KiCad/FabFiles).
If all the files required by your manufacturer are there, download the '.zip' file in that directory and submit it.
