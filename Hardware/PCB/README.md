## Parts List
CSV of components available in [Hardware/PCB/KiCad/parts_list.csv](https://github.com/UCHIC/CIWS-Pulse-Logger/blob/main/Hardware/PCB/KiCad/parts_list.csv).

## Instructions
For convenience several common fabrication files have been generated and can be found in [Hardware/PCB/KiCad/FabFiles](https://github.com/UCHIC/CIWS-Pulse-Logger/tree/main/Hardware/PCB/KiCad/FabFiles).
If all the files required by your manufacturer are there, download the `.zip` file in that directory and submit it.

If your manufacturer has questions about parts direct them to the [parts csv](https://github.com/UCHIC/CIWS-Pulse-Logger/blob/main/Hardware/PCB/KiCad/parts_list.csv).

If additional fabrication files are needed download the files in [Hardware/PCB/KiCad/ProjectFiles](https://github.com/UCHIC/CIWS-Pulse-Logger/tree/main/Hardware/PCB/KiCad/ProjectFiles). In KiCad open the `.pro` file and follow your manufatures instructions for generating fabrication files.
