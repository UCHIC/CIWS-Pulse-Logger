# CIWS-Pulse-Logger

This repository contains hardware and software designs for a full pulse-resolution datalogger that can be used to collect high resolution water use data on magnetically-driven residential water meters. The datalogger is designed to read magnetic field information from a magnetometer sensor attached to a magnetically-driven, positive-displacement water meter. The pulses can then be recorded with individual timestamps or aggregated into magnetic pulses per time period, where the time period is configurable by the user. 

Firmware: The Firmware folder contains code written for the datalogger.

Hardware: The Hardware folder contains hardware design information for off-the-shelf components as well as a 
manufacturable PCB.

## Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply (CIWS) 

CIWS is a project funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation to develop cyberinfrastructure for smart water metering and high resolution water-use data collection. We are developing systems for high resolution residential water consumption data collection, processing and analysis.
